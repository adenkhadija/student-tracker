# Student-Tracker

# Overveiw: 
This project is a lightweight web application built to help educators track student attendance, reading/writing progress, notes, and parent resources.
I created this app because I teach Arabic reading and writing to 15–20 students on weekends, and I needed a centralized place to organize each student’s learning journey. This tool gives me (and other teachers) a simple and organized way to:
- Record daily attendance
- Track academic progress over time
- Write notes for myself and for parents
- Maintain a resource library for parents to support learning at home

# Features: 

📅 Attendance Tracking: 
- View all students on one page
- Mark Present / Absent / Late
- Store attendance history for each date
  
📊 Learning Progress Tracking: 
- Track reading/writing milestones
- Log lessons covered each week
- Add teacher notes and parent notes

👨‍👩‍👧 Parent Resource Hub
- Add and categorize learning materials
- Links to reading tools, Tajweed resources, worksheets, etc.
