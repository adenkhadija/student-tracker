# 📚 Student Tracker (React + Vite)

The Student Tracker is a simple web application built to help track student attendance, learning progress, and notes for parents.  
I created this project to support my weekend Arabic reading & writing classes, where I teach 15–20 students and needed a better way to organize progress and communication.

This is my first React project, built using Vite for development.
